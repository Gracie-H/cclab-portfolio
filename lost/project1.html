        <h2>PROJECT 1</h2>
        <h1>Lost and Found</h1>
        <h1>For my "Lost and Found" project, I created a bracelet inspired by the description of multiple small round stones tied together, with blue, white, and grey tones. The bracelet featured a variety of materials with differing textures and irregular shapes. To represent this visually, I used circles of varying sizes to create the texture, symbolizing the unique characteristics of each stone. I expanded on the original description by incorporating additional colors, including the background, to emphasize the emotional significance of the bracelet. This choice allowed me to highlight its personal importance and create a richer, more evocative visual representation.
