        <h1>The most important thing I learned is to simplify code logic by building a “system”. For example, I first create the background's rectangle by altering their X and Y positions, testing with different number values every time, which is too complicated. So, I learned i, i++, and i < height can create a loop, making a code block repeat multiple times. Understanding this circulation is the most challenging part of this assignment.

            The second challenge I faced was that I tried many methods to control the change in the face, eyes, and mouth, together with the mouse's movement. I decided to use the function of combining into the same group or same layer in PS and AI, but unfortunately, I have not figured out how to incorporate in groups. So, I learned about Offset. I set the Offset to randomly change my face's position and size with a range from—circleSize * 0.2 to circleSize * 0.2.</h1>
