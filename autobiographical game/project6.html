        <h1>My autobiographical game is inspired by my dreams, which reflect and shape my experiences. A year ago, I had a dream about my dog, and that dream was particularly real. The dream scene was of a six-year-old me playing with my dog in the ocean. My dog died a few years ago, in the twelfth year of his arrival in our home. She was with me growing up. Her name was didi.

            I grew up living at school and only coming home on the weekends. Yet on the day it died, a Monday, my dad didn't call me directly to meet him. Instead, he told me on the way home from picking me up on Friday, citing concerns about disrupting my studies. When I got home, I was no longer greeted with didi joy.
            
            There is no order to the start of the game, and the player can click at will. There are three items in the middle of the first act, click at will. Follow the order from left to right. Clicking on the first item leads to a click-and-eliminate game. The screen is filled with avatars belonging to six-year-old gracie and didi. Representing the memory bubbles of the two of us. The player needs to find the most special one that will lead to the next mini-game. The maze, the beginning and the end of the maze had the logos of my two schools. My first school, GCGS, covered my elementary middle school and high school. The second school is Parsons. The number of successful steps in the maze is twelve, which means twelve years, the number of years didi and I have grown up together and been together. When the player moves to the Parsons logo. which is the year didi passed away, it moves to the next game. A game of dodge and pick up. It's a didi with cherub wings dodging the ufo that took it away playing with me by picking up balls. When all the balls are picked up. The game is over. Switch to a picture. It's the footprints of didi and I walking together by the beach in the dream.
