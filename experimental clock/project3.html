            <h2>PROJECT 3</h2>
            <h1>Experimental Clock</h1>


        <h3>My experimental clock uses a flower that gradually fades and turns black to represent time. my experimental clock is different from traditional timekeeping, focusing on natural decay and transformation rather than precise intervals. It offers a reflective, emotional experience of time.

            I think three idea, the first one is the fading, dying process of the flower. The second is the diffusivity of water. And my last idea is the ash accumulation. I choose the flower fading process because it has a certain life cycle in the nature. Compare to other two idea, the water diffusion and the ash have more uncertainty than the flower, which the flower can be more accurate and suitable for time.
            
            This project let me rethink about the concept of time, other process of recording time. It also lead me to think profoundly about the human activities interact with environment. Again, thinking then logic of computing systematically. At start, i test many time for each location of the flower, the X, Y position, because I forget to use the function mouseX and mouseY. </h1>
