        <h1>
            My project's pattern is inspired by chinese philosophy, the continuity and unlimity. so I only use circle as a symbol of possibilities. Also, I add the eyes and circles coperated with blue, red color to build a surrealistic visual effects.
            
            optical illusion is how the colors, movements, and the lights stimulate the eyes and brains. so my visual strategy is try to use reduplicate circle movement to create the dizzy effect. The oscillating sizes of the circles are like expansions and contractions creating visual hypnosis, drawing the viewer's attention inside to feel the vibrations and artifacts of the outer circle.
            
            
            This visual illusion can be used in a variety of situations. The illusion can be used in web design or as a dynamic artwork in digital installations, as well as printed as a pattern on wearable fabrics such as t-shirts or hats, canvas bags, or even accessory.</h1>
